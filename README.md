# Cloud4Sustainability

This project is based on the [Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability data model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/common-data-model/schema/core/industrycommon/sustainability/overview) which was only available in the [Microsoft Dataverse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro) but now also for Azure SQL Databases or Microsoft SQL Server!
